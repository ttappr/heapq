//! ## Heap queue algorithm (a.k.a. priority queue).
//!
//! Heaps are arrays for which `a[k] <= a[2*k+1]` and `a[k] <= a[2*k+2]` for
//! all `k`, counting elements from `0`.  For the sake of comparison,
//! non-existing elements are considered to be infinite.  The interesting
//! property of a heap is that `a[0]` is always its smallest element.
//!
//! Usage:
//! 
//! ```rust,ignore
//! // create an empty heap
//! let mut heap = vec![];
//!
//! // push a new item on the heap
//! heap_push(&mut heap, item);
//!
//! // pop the smallest item from the heap
//! let item = heap_pop(&mut heap);
//!
//! // get the smallest item on the heap without popping it
//! let item = &heap[0];
//!
//! // transform slice into a heap, in-place, in linear time
//! heapify(&mut x);
//!
//! // push a new item and then returns the smallest item; the heap size is
//! // unchanged
//! item = heap_pushpop(&mut heap, item);
//!
//! // pop and returns smallest item, and adds new item; the heap size is
//! // unchanged
//! item = heap_replace(&mut heap, item);
//! ```
//! 
//! Our API differs from textbook heap algorithms as follows:
//!
//! - We use 0-based indexing.  This makes the relationship between the
//!   index for a node and the indexes for its children slightly less
//!   obvious, but is more suitable since Rust uses 0-based indexing.
//! - Our `heap_pop()` method returns the smallest item, not the largest.
//!
//! These two make it possible to view the heap as a regular Rust slice
//! without surprises: `heap[0]` is the smallest item, and `heap.sort()`
//! maintains the heap invariant!
//!
//! ## Heap queues
//!
//! *explanation by FranÃ§ois Pinard*
//!
//! Heaps are arrays for which `a[k] <= a[2*k+1]` and `a[k] <= a[2*k+2]` for
//! all `k`, counting elements from `0`.  For the sake of comparison,
//! non-existing elements are considered to be infinite.  The interesting
//! property of a heap is that `a[0]` is always its smallest element.
//!
//! The strange invariant above is meant to be an efficient memory
//! representation for a tournament.  The numbers below are `k`, not `a[k]`:
//! ```ignore
//!                                    0
//!
//!                   1                                 2
//!
//!           3               4                5               6
//!
//!       7       8       9       10      11      12      13      14
//!
//!     15 16   17 18   19 20   21 22   23 24   25 26   27 28   29 30
//! ```
//!
//! In the tree above, each cell `k` is topping `2*k+1` and `2*k+2`.  In
//! a usual binary tournament we see in sports, each cell is the winner
//! over the two cells it tops, and we can trace the winner down the tree
//! to see all opponents s/he had.  However, in many computer applications
//! of such tournaments, we do not need to trace the history of a winner.
//! To be more memory efficient, when a winner is promoted, we try to
//! replace it by something else at a lower level, and the rule becomes
//! that a cell and the two cells it tops contain three different items,
//! but the top cell "wins" over the two topped cells.
//!
//! If this heap invariant is protected at all time, index 0 is clearly
//! the overall winner.  The simplest algorithmic way to remove it and
//! find the "next" winner is to move some loser (let's say cell 30 in the
//! diagram above) into the 0 position, and then percolate this new 0 down
//! the tree, exchanging values, until the invariant is re-established.
//! This is clearly logarithmic on the total number of items in the tree.
//! By iterating over all items, you get an `O(n ln n)` sort.
//!
//! A nice feature of this sort is that you can efficiently insert new
//! items while the sort is going on, provided that the inserted items are
//! not "better" than the last 0'th element you extracted.  This is
//! especially useful in simulation contexts, where the tree holds all
//! incoming events, and the "win" condition means the smallest scheduled
//! time.  When an event schedule other events for execution, they are
//! scheduled into the future, so they can easily go into the heap.  So, a
//! heap is a good structure for implementing schedulers (this is what I
//! used for my MIDI sequencer :-).
//!
//! Various structures for implementing schedulers have been extensively
//! studied, and heaps are good for this, as they are reasonably speedy,
//! the speed is almost constant, and the worst case is not much different
//! than the average case.  However, there are other representations which
//! are more efficient overall, yet the worst cases might be terrible.
//!
//! Heaps are also very useful in big disk sorts.  You most probably all
//! know that a big sort implies producing "runs" (which are pre-sorted
//! sequences, which size is usually related to the amount of CPU memory),
//! followed by a merging passes for these runs, which merging is often
//! very cleverly organised[^1].  It is very important that the initial
//! sort produces the longest runs possible.  Tournaments are a good way
//! to that.  If, using all the memory available to hold a tournament, you
//! replace and percolate items that happen to fit the current run, you'll
//! produce runs which are twice the size of the memory for random input,
//! and much better for input fuzzily ordered.
//!
//! Moreover, if you output the 0'th item on disk and get an input which
//! may not fit in the current tournament (because the value "wins" over
//! the last output value), it cannot fit in the heap, so the size of the
//! heap decreases.  The freed memory could be cleverly reused immediately
//! for progressively building a second heap, which grows at exactly the
//! same rate the first heap is melting.  When the first heap completely
//! vanishes, you switch heaps and start a new run.  Clever and quite
//! effective!
//!
//! In a word, heaps are useful memory structures to know.  I use them in
//! a few applications, and I think it is good to keep a `heap` module
//! around. :-)
//!
//! [^1]: The disk balancing algorithms which are current, nowadays, are
//! more annoying than clever, and this is a consequence of the seeking
//! capabilities of the disks.  On devices which cannot seek, like big
//! tape drives, the story was quite different, and one had to be very
//! clever to ensure (far in advance) that each tape movement will be the
//! most effective possible (that is, will best participate at
//! "progressing" the merge).  Some tapes were even able to read
//! backwards, and this was also used to avoid the rewinding time.
//! Believe me, real good tape sorts were quite spectacular to watch!
//! From all times, sorting has always been a Great Art! :-)

//
// We *could* break out of the loop as soon as we find a pos where newitem <=
// both its children, but turns out that's not a good idea, and despite that
// many books write the algorithm that way.  During a heap pop, the last array
// element is sifted in, and that tends to be large, so that comparing it
// against values starting from the root usually doesn't pay (= usually doesn't
// get us out of the loop early).  See Knuth, Volume 3, where this is
// explained and quantified in an exercise.
//
// Cutting the # of comparisons is important, since these routines have no
// way to extract "the priority" from an array element, so that intelligence
// is likely to be hiding in custom comparison methods, or in array elements
// storing (priority, record) tuples.  Comparisons are thus potentially
// expensive.
//
// On random arrays of length 1000, making this change cut the number of
// comparisons made by heapify() a little, and those made by exhaustive
// heappop() a lot, in accord with theory.  Here are typical results from 3
// runs (3 just to demonstrate how small the variance is):
//
// Compares needed by heapify     Compares needed by 1000 heappops
// --------------------------     --------------------------------
// 1837 cut to 1663               14996 cut to 8680
// 1855 cut to 1659               14966 cut to 8678
